# Privacy Policy
Thank you for using Moody! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

<br>

## 1. Information We Collect
Moody is designed to help you track your moods and emotions privately and securely. We may collect the following types of information:

- Mood Entries: Moods, tags, notes, and other data you voluntarily enter into the app.
- Usage Data: Anonymous data such as session length, app crashes, or feature usage, to improve performance and user experience.
We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless explicitly stated (e.g., if you create an account in future versions).

<br>

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information you provide to:

- Help you log and track your moods.
- Generate insights and mood trends.
- Improve app performance and user experience.
Your data is stored locally on your device unless you enable cloud backup or synchronization features (if applicable).

## 3. Third-Party Services
Moody may use trusted third-party tools for analytics or crash reporting. These services may collect limited technical data, such as device type or operating system version, but no personal mood data is shared.

We may update this section if new services are added in future versions.

<br>

## 4. Data Security
We take data security seriously. All data is stored securely on your device or, if cloud sync is enabled, securely transmitted using industry-standard encryption.

You are responsible for protecting your device and any backups you make.
